So far I have a public boolean that tests whether or not the new string of words will over lap or not with the new words. 
It works both with vertical,horizontal as well as diagonals. There is a boolean that tests whether or not the new word 
will overlap or not. I filled in the dots with random letters of the alphabets as well. I can add words diagonall, 
horizontally, and vertically but I have not yet made it so it can read from a text document.
